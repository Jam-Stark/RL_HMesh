# TopoHexMeshLib_sheet_singularity

## Description

This project, TopoHexMeshLib_sheet_singularity, appears to be a C++ application with Python integration, focused on hexahedral mesh processing, specifically dealing with sheet singularity operations and mesh quality assessment. It utilizes a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent, implemented in Python, to guide mesh optimization processes. The C++ core handles mesh data structures, topological operations (like sheet collapse and singularity number generation), and mesh quality calculations. The Python agent, likely using PyTorch, makes decisions on actions to perform on the mesh, learns from these actions, and can save/load its state.

## Features

* **Hexahedral Mesh Operations:**
  * Loading and writing of `.Qhex` mesh files.
  * Sheet operations including identifying, collapsing, and predicting collapse energy of sheets.
  * Singularity number generation and tracking.
  * Calculation of various mesh quality metrics (Jacobian, Scaled Jacobian, Diagonal, Edge Ratio).
* **Reinforcement Learning for Mesh Optimization:**
  * Integrates a Python-based RL agent (using `pybind11`).
  * The agent can choose actions, remember states and rewards, and replay experiences to learn.
  * Supports loading pre-trained models and memory for the agent.
* **State Representation:**
  * Defines a `State` class in C++ to represent mesh characteristics for the RL agent. Features include sheet energy, boundary/feature ratios, curvature metrics, normal/dihedral angle variations, and Jacobian values.
* **Logging:**
  * Generates detailed logs for main program execution, debug information, sheet operations, and RL training progress. Logs are organized by build mode (Debug/Release) and session timestamp.
* **Command-line Interface:**
  * The main executable (`RL_Mesh_demo`) accepts a mesh directory path and optional arguments for loading RL models and memory.

## Dependencies

* **C++:**
  * Standard C++ libraries (`iostream`, `fstream`, `vector`, `sstream`, `filesystem`, `chrono`, `algorithm`, `random`, etc.)
  * `pybind11` for C++/Python interoperability.
* **Python (for the RL agent):**
  * `torch` (PyTorch) for neural networks.
  * `numpy` for numerical operations.
  * `random`
  * `os`
  * `pickle` (for saving/loading replay memory).
* **Project-Specific Libraries:**
  * `HMeshLib`: A core library providing topological data structures and operations for hexahedral meshes. This includes components for vertices, edges, faces, hexes, iterators, and geometric calculations.

## Usage

The main program `RL_Mesh_demo` (compiled from `main.cpp`) is executed from the command line.

**Syntax:**

```bash
RL_Mesh_demo <mesh_directory_path> [--load-model] [--model-path=path] [--memory-path=path]
```

**Parameters:**

* `<mesh_directory_path>`: (Required) Path to the folder containing `.Qhex` mesh files to be processed.
* `--load-model`: (Optional) If present, the program will attempt to load a previously saved RL agent model and its replay memory.
* `--model-path=path`: (Optional) Specifies the path to the RL agent's model file. Defaults to `python_modules/models/model.pt` if `--load-model` is used and this is not provided.
* `--memory-path=path`: (Optional) Specifies the path to the RL agent's replay memory file. Defaults to `python_modules/models/memory.pkl` if `--load-model` is used and this is not provided.

**Example:**

**Bash**

```
./RL_Mesh_demo ../data/meshes --load-model --model-path=saved_models/agent_v1.pt --memory-path=saved_models/memory_v1.pkl
```

The program will iterate through each `.Qhex` file in the specified directory, performing mesh optimization operations guided by the RL agent for a set number of episodes per file. Processed meshes are saved in `F://RL_HMesh//data//results//` with a suffix indicating the episode number.
